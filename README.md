# Hi

## Who am I ?

I'm a system & cloud engineer, open source advocate, DevOps practitioner and software developer (at part-time) living in :switzerland: 

## What keeps me busy ?

### Bacula-Web project OSS project

Most of my spare time is dedicated to the [Bacula-Web](https://www.bacula-web.org) open source project.

### Bacula (community edition) packages

Bacula community edition packages used to be maintained and built by myself, I gave a lot of time and energy for free to provide rpm & deb packages to the
community for free.
For further details, check the [Bacula](https://wwww.bacula.org) project website, and [this link](https://www.bacula.org/bacula-binary-package-download/) for the
.rpm and .deb packages.

### mhVTL GUI

[mhvtl](https://github.com/markh794/mhvtl) is a Linux based Virtual Tape Library maintained by [Mark Harvey](https://github.com/markh794).

I'll start soon to work on a fork of the web UI.
Here's the [mhvtl-gui](https://github.com/dfranco/mhvtl-gui) repository on GitHub for further details.

### Other contributions

I also try to help others with pull requests, answering GH issues, commiting on other OSS projects here on GitHub, but also on different platform.

Here's my GitHub stats
