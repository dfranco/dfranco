# Who am I ?

I'm a System / Cloud engineer, Open Source advocate, DevOps practitioner and software developer at part-time.

## What are my contributions ?

- I spend most of my time on the [Bacula-Web](https://www.bacula-web.org) open source project (GPLv2)
- I've made dozens of contributions to different open source project by help other users trough GitHub issues comment, 
  creating PR, etc.
- During few years, I used to build and maintain rpm and deb packages for [Bacula](https://wwww.bacula.org) open source project
  More details are available [here](https://www.bacula.org/bacula-binary-package-download/)

## What I currently working on ...

- bring back from darkness [my personal blog](https://www.dflc.ch) which used to be running with [WordPress](https://  wordpress.org/) a few months/years ago, until I got in trouble with an upgrade.
I'm still working hard to bring back a huge amount of posts and content :grimacing: (it is now powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with :heart:)
- backing another release of the open source project [Bacula-Web](https://github.com/bacula-web/bacula-web) to provide some new features, bug fixes and if I got enough time, more nice things related to this project
